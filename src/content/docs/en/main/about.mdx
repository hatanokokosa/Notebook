#### Where is this?

This is kks's personal website. I'll probably record some stuff here, such as: study notes, diary entries, drawings, OCs, things I randomly want to write after watching something... basically anything I can think of. So the categories here will be quite detailed.

As for my Blog (the "Kokosa's Blog" above), I'll put things that I think belong in a blog, since it has RSS.

#### Self Q&A:

Q: Why use serif font ( Noto Serif & Baskervville )?  
A: Because it looks good. Source Han Sans looks weird, readability doesn't matter lol

Q: Who will read this?  
A: No idea! Who has nothing better to do than visit my website, probably just friends from chat groups

#### Friend link format:

Add to `src/data/friends.ts` or just send to me the link and I'll add it

```typescript
{
  link: "https://your-site.com/",
  title: "Your Name",
  avatar: "/friends/your-avatar.avif",
  desc: "Say something random",
}
```

> Better than the old HTML fmt
