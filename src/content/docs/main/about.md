#### Where is this?

This is kks's personal website. I'll probably record some stuff here, such as: study notes, diary entries, drawings, OCs, things I randomly want to write after watching something... basically anything I can think of. So the categories here will be quite detailed.

As for my Blog (the "Kokosa's Blog" above), I'll put things that I think belong in a blog, since it has RSS.

#### Self Q&A:

Q: Why use serif font ( Noto Serif & Baskervville )?  
A: Because it looks good. Source Han Sans looks weird, readability doesn't matter lol

Q: Who will read this?  
A: No idea! Who has nothing better to do than visit my website, probably just friends from chat groups

Q: Why use English?  
A: Because I like the Baskervville font, and I don't plan to add i18n

Q: Why is the SVG on the homepage Nix's SVG?  
A: Because I haven't made my own SVG yet, so it's just a placeholder

#### Friend link format:

```html
<a href="your-target-url" class="friend-card">
    <div class="friend-avatar-container">
        <img src="/friends/your-avatar" class="friend-avatar" /> //or avatar link works too
    </div>
    <div class="friend-info">
        <h3>Your Name</h3>
        <div class="friend-url">
            Your URL
        </div>
        <p>Say something random</p>
    </div>
</a>
```
> What a SUCKY friend link format...
